## Introduction

Hi students! 👋

Welcome to your **Mini JavaScript Project**! This is a great opportunity for you to test and challenge your knowledge of JavaScript. In this project, you'll be building the functionality for a webpage using JavaScript. The HTML and CSS files are already provided, so your task is to focus solely on **adding JavaScript** to bring the website to life.

## Project Overview

Once you open the live link, you’ll see a **list of tasks** that you need to complete. These tasks are designed to help you practice various JavaScript concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and logic implementation.

### Key Details:
- **Tasks are independent of each other** — you can tackle them in any order.
- Each task will test different aspects of JavaScript functionality, so make sure to approach them step-by-step.
- Use the provided HTML and CSS as the foundation, but you’ll need to **add JavaScript** to make the page interactive and functional.

## What You’ll practice:
- **DOM Manipulation:** How to interact with and update HTML elements using JavaScript.
- **Event Handling:** How to handle user interactions like clicks, typing, etc.



## Tips for Success:
- **Start simple:** Focus on one task at a time. Don’t worry if you don’t get everything perfect on the first try.
- **Test often:** As you add JavaScript, test the functionality in the browser to make sure everything works as expected.
- **Use the browser console:** If you run into issues, open the **Developer Tools** (press `F12` in most browsers) and check the **Console** for errors or logs.
- **Practice makes perfect:** If you’re stuck, review the JavaScript concepts we’ve covered in class or refer to the documentation.


Good luck, and have fun coding! 🎉 If you need any help, feel free to reach out during the session or in our Slack group.
